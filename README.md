# Project: ritual arena
I am combining chess and cards to make a game. Let's see if it works. ;)

This is my best attempt yet of making a game. And I will do all I can to finish it.
My plan is to start a devlog on youtube to show the development.

I have made a playable prototype in Tabletop Simulator: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1995847994
with rules: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10tiLrvUtJ5NOCxgdUNiRcA1h923_Tm2QtqxlAEIU_e8/edit?usp=sharing

Any feedback is welcome :)
